## Knapsack Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the knapsack algorithm, a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The knapsack problem aims to maximize the value of items selected while keeping their total weight within a given limit.

### Usage

To use the knapsack algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `knapsack.py` file.
4. Modify the `values`, `weights`, and `max_weight` variables in the `knapsack.py` file to represent your specific problem instance.
5. Run the `knapsack.py` file using Python.
6. The algorithm will output the selected items and the maximum value achieved within the weight limit.

### Example

```python
weights = [1, 3, 4, 5]
values = [1, 4, 5, 7]
res, optimized_value = knapsack(values, weights, 7)
print(f"Value of elements in knapsack: {res}, and the maximal value is: {optimized_value}")
```

This example initializes `weights` and `values` arrays representing the weights and values of items respectively. The `knapsack` function is then called with these arrays along with the maximum weight limit. The selected items and the maximum value achieved are then printed to the console.
